## About

This is a visualisation tool for AVL tree in React.js with insert/delete and search operations

You can see try the live demo here - https://JAYKRISHNAN.github.io/AVL-Tree-Visualizer-in-React

AVL tree is a height balanced binary search tree that always ensure O(log(n)) time complexity for insert/delete/search operations

Height balancing is done by 4 types of AVL rotations depending on the type of height imbalance after a normal BST insertion/deletion

- Right Right Rotation
- Left Left Rotation
- Right Left Rotation
- Left Right Rotation

The tool also supports 3 types of DFS traversal

- In Order Traversal
- Pre Order Traversal
- Post Order Traversal

The tool also supports BFS traversal of the tree
